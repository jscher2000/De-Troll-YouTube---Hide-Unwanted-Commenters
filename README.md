# De-Troll YouTube - Hide Unwanted Commenters
For firefox:  Right-click a comment (or reply) or click the trash can next to their name to hide the commenter using their channel ID. Not an official YouTube extension.

**Update as of April 16, 2023**

I probably won't develop this further because it's a feature of the popular extension: [BlockTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/blocktube/)
